# SimSig Clients #

This suite of programmes use the [SimSig Gateway Interface](https://github.com/Gwasanaethau/SimSigGatewayInterface) package to connect to SimSig servers, and provide various examples of what can be done with the [SimSig](www.simsig.co.uk) [Interface Gateway](http://www.simsig.co.uk/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=usertrack:interface_gateway) feeds.

### Requirements ###

In addition to the interface library mentioned above, the [Strampáil](https://github.com/Gwasanaethau/Stramp-il) STOMP Client Interface is also required to connect to the SimSig STOMP server. Use will also need a Java 7 compatible JRE (or JDK if you wish to compile the code), and the SimSig simulation that will act as the server.

### May I use this? ###

The project is licensed under the MIT Licence, so be my guest!

### Can I use this? ###

That depends – this is very much ‘pre-α’ at the moment. It is very unlikely to become any more developed than my personal needs/intrigue requires. Chances are it will not implement much of the STOMP protocol beyond what I need it for. It may not even be useable for that. I make no guarantees regarding security or stability of the code.

**Do not use in production code!**

### Are you affiliated with SimSig, Cajon Rail LLC, etc? ###

No, most definitely not! I merely use their products (and fun products they are)!

### Current Status ###

These are merely test programmes at the moment.
